# Bit manipulation

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `Alx Africa`. It aims to learn about how to manipulate` bits` and use `bitwise` operators in C language.

## Technologies

- C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- C files are written according to the C90 standard.
- Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.

## Test

- [test](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/test): This directory contains all my main.c and exe files for this project.

## Main.h 

- [main.h](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## Files

> All of the following files are programs written in C:

| _FIlename_ | _Description_ | _Prototype_ |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| [0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c) | a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. | `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)` |
| [1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c) | a function that prints the binary representation of a number. | void print_binary(unsigned long int n) |
| [2-get_bit.c](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c) | a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. | int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index) |
| [3-set_bit.c](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c) | a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. | `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index` |
