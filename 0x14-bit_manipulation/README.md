# Bit manipulation

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `Alx Africa`. It aims to learn about how to manipulate` bits` and use `bitwise` operators in C language.

## Technologies

- C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- C files are written according to the C90 standard.
- Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.

## Test

- [test](https://github.com/Sanoxi/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/test): This directory contains all my main.c and exe files for this project.
